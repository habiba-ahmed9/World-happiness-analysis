## 📌 Project Overview

**Project Happiness** is a data storytelling initiative that explores what makes countries happy. Using the **World Happiness Ranking dataset** from Kaggle (2015–2016), we clean, visualize, and interpret global well‑being patterns across **157 countries per year** (314 total records).

> 🎯 **Three main goals:**  
> 
> | Goal | Description |
> |------|-------------|
> | 🔧 **Data Harmony** | Clean raw data – handle missing values, remove unusable columns |
> | 📊 **Visual Joy** | Build an insightful & aesthetic **Power BI dashboard** |
> | 📖 **The Happy Story** | Present findings in a clear **PowerPoint report** |

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process (Detailed)

We identified and fixed three main data quality issues:

### Issue 1: Zero Values in Continuous Metrics
| Problem | Example | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Several countries show `0.00` in Health, Family, or Freedom | Central African Republic had `0.000` in Family (2015) – unrealistic | Replace zeros with `NaN` (likely missing data, not true zero) |

### Issue 2: Extreme Outliers
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Very low Economy or Health scores (near-zero values) | Investigate manually – some are real (conflict zones, low-income nations), others are errors |

### Issue 3: Missing Data Handling
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Some columns had **>90% missing values** | Removed entirely to avoid misleading analysis |

✅ **Final dataset:** Clean, consistent, and ready for visualization.
